# Dominion

This project is seriously in development. Don't use it. Seriously.

Here are the goals:

1. The ability to use Django templates within Fabric;
2. A Django-esque, Python method for declaring configuration (think Puppet using Django models)
3. Fabric as the front-end transport
4. Easy configuration for different environments.

Right now the only thing that's done is (1). Who knows when the rest will be done.
