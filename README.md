# Dominion

Dominion provides easy configuration management for Django projects. 
Think Puppet for Python/Django. 

It's in development, if you'd like to use it please send me some 
email at paulcwatts@gmail.com. Here's what it can basically do right now:

1. Adds the ability to use Django templates within Fabric
2. Provides a Django-esque, Pythonic method for declaring configuration (Puppet meets Django models)
3. Fabric as the front-end transport
4. Configuration for different roles and environments.

Things that it doesn't provide right now:

1. Unit tests
2. Documentation
